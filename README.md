# cat_laser_system

### Description
This is a system designed to keep your cat busy and active with lasers in a designated area even when you're not at home. 
The objective of this project is to maximize a cat's stimulation without a human presence. 

### Hardware 
* Jumper Wires (FF & MM)
* Arduino Uno
* Motion Sensor 
* Elegoo Arduino Laser Emitter 
* 2X 9g Servo Motors 
* 9V Battery w/ cable
* Copper Wires 

## Project Timeline 

- [X]  ~~TUE 10-26-2021: Get motion sensor working.~~
- [X]  ~~WED 10-27-2021: Get Servo motors working.~~
                  ~~Get dimensions and begin modeling a housing for the device.~~
- [X]  ~~THU 10-28-2021: 3D print first iteration of the housing for device components.~~ 
- [X]  ~~FRI 10-29-2021: Get laser working and integrate with other components.~~

- [X]  ~~MON 11-01-2021: Create laser patterns.~~ 
- [X]  ~~TUE 11-02-2021: Iron out any unexpected bugs or issues.~~
- [X]  ~~WED 11-03-2021: Begin report/presentation.~~

## TODO

* ~~Need better wires. Specifically we need more Male-Female wires.~~
* ~~Get USB Flash Drive for 3D printing.~~
* ~~Print first iteration of housing.~~ 
* ~~Finalize housing dimensions.~~ 
	* ~~The Pan servo needs screw hole on the back side opposite of the wire opening.~~
	* ~~Servo to laser beam connection dimensions are perfect and should be copied to the Pan Servo to Tilt Servo connection.~~ 
* **Fix laser and motion sensor logic.** 
* **Assemble servos together.**
