# cat_laser_system

### Description
This is a system designed to keep your cat busy and active with lasers in a designated area even when you're not at home. 
The objective of this project is to maximize a cat's stimulation without a human presence. 

### Hardware 
* Jumper Wires (FF & MM)
* Arduino Uno
* Motion Sensor 
* Elegoo Arduino Laser Emitter 
* 2X 9g Servo Motors 
* 9V Battery w/ cable
* Copper Wires 

## Project Timeline 

* **TUE 10-26-2021: Get motion sensor working.**
* **WED 10-27-2021: Get Servo motors working.**
                  **Get dimensions and begin modeling a housing for the device.**
* **THU 10-28-2021: 3D print first iteration of the housing for device components.** 
* **FRI 10-29-2021: Get laser working and integrate with other components.** 

* **MON 11-01-2021: Create laser patterns.** 
* **TUE 11-02-2021: Iron out any unexpected bugs or issues.**
* **WED 11-03-2021: Begin report/presentation.** 

## TODO
